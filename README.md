# homework2

Hello grader! This is a resubmit of my homework assignment #2: Responsive Portfolio. 


In this assignment I have created four pages: contact.html, index.html, portfolio.html, and reset.css.

contact.html 
Includes a responsive navbar and responsive containers with contact info.
<img src="assets/contactSS" alt="Screenshot of Contact page">

index.html
Includes a responsive navbar and responsive images.
<img src="assets/homeSS" alt="Screenshot of Home page">

portfolio.html
Includes Bacon Ipsum for now, but will eventually consist of all current projects.
<img src="assets/portfolioSS" alt="Screenshot of Portfolio page">

reset.css
This resets the default CSS on any browser.


Also included is an assets folder which stores my images.
